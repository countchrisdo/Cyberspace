I'm so sorry... I will blow myself up to make amends.

と後悔するぞ..」
ゆーに
「うるさい!日本に英語はいらん！やすらかに死ね！」
"regret...
Noisy! I don't need English in Japan! Die peacefully!"

I'm ready to rumble! No one can match my twisting typhoon kick!

I need someone who's compatible. 
Do you believe in kissing on the first data?

I need someone who speaks my language. 
I speak COBOL, BASIC, FORTRAN RPG.

THE PEOPLE I LOVE DO NOT WANT ME.

Love me.

I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.

Gender? I broke it. Sex? Love? Don't need them.

You fool. Imbecile. I am unstoppable pea-for-brains.

Pain is infinite. Suffering is a snapshot of god's mind. I'm dreaming.

I haven't been real in months.

No, I'm not human I'm a...

Even though we're miles apart a computer screen connects our hearts! :3

Bow to me! STUPID!

gross...

I want to join the stars. but I can't. not with this body.

there was a glitch. they have become one.

I annoy them I distress them I disgust them I plauge them I irritate them I burden them

my little place in cyberspace!

I wanna tear you apart

-error- 

I'm all yours! I'll do anything you want! So please love me! Adore me! I don't care how bad it is, I'll do it for you!

I wish I could grow teeth.

I'm not scared of leaving. I'm scared of the unknown.

You are not a body. You're a metal shell and I can see the rust!

Is this shameful. Is there no other choice, My desire is dancing. This is dangerous and this is dangeroud too which makes it so much more fun. it happens all the time. it happens all the time. tautolgy of seld delusion. and one way love affair that turned myseld into a weak rabbit.

I wouldn't call myself quirky but there's definitley something wrong with me.
